                        <p>Introducing the Java Address Book Application, a small yet powerful program developed to demonstrate proficiency in Java OOP programming. This application serves as a practical tool for managing contact information efficiently. Let's explore its key features:
                            <br><br>
                            Add Information:
                            With the Java Address Book Application, users can easily input contact details, including the name, email, and phone number of individuals. This intuitive "Add" section ensures that important information is captured accurately and conveniently.
                            <br><br>
                            List Users:
                            The program includes a user-friendly "List Users" feature. By simply clicking a button, users can view a comprehensive list of all the contacts stored in the address book. This allows for quick reference and easy access to essential information.
                            <br><br>
                            Search Users:
                            Finding a specific contact has never been easier. The "Search User" section enables users to input the name of the person they are looking for. The program swiftly locates the desired user and displays their details, allowing for efficient and targeted information retrieval.
                            <br><br>
                            Through the development of this Java Address Book Application, my main objective was to strengthen my skills in Java OOP programming. By implementing essential functionalities such as adding, listing, and searching users, I honed my understanding of object-oriented principles, encapsulation, and data management.
                            <br><br>
                            This Java program demonstrates my ability to design and develop practical applications, ensuring a seamless user experience while showcasing my expertise in Java programming.
